    "Sometimes love is a quiet feeling, but what I feel for you echoes loudly, across every mile that separates us.",
    "You're the dream I can’t stop dreaming, even though we’ve never met, I know our souls have already touched.",
    "Meeting you will feel like catching up with someone I've known for a thousand lifetimes.",
    "Every word, every thought of you fills my heart with a warmth that I’ve never known before.",
    "One day, when we're finally together, I’ll remind you every day just how much your absence made me realize what true love is.",
    "You are the missing piece I didn’t know I was searching for, but now I can’t imagine my life without you.",
    "I wonder if you can feel it too—this connection, this pull that brings my heart closer to yours every day."
